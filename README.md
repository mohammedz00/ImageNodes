# ImageNodes

Blender is an open source 3D software, used for modelling, shading, animation and visual effects among many others.

In this software, is the ability to create Python scripts which interact with the 3D workspace and procedural nodes. This Python script was created in order to firstly experiment with the Blender Python module, but to also take advantage of its ability to improve the speed of workflow by transforming repetitive tasks into a simple click of a button.

It can be time consuming to repeatedly add the same nodes when using the image texture node in order to achieve a realistic product. I created this as it now only takes one click or one shortcut key press to do this work
